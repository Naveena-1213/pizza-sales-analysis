1) Background and Overview
   
In todayâ€™s competitive food and beverage market, understanding product-level and category-level performance is key to driving revenue and customer loyalty.
This project focuses on analyzing a pizza restaurant's sales data to identify top-selling products, seasonal patterns, and opportunities for strategic growth.

Objective:
Transform raw sales data into actionable business insights
Enable data-driven decision-making for marketing, inventory, and product development

2) Data Structure Overview
The dataset includes transactional sales records with the following key fields:

`order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
`order_date`: Date of purchase
`pizza_id`: Unique identifier for each pizza
`pizza_name`: Name of the pizza
`pizza_category`: Category (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken)
`pizza_size`: Size of the pizza (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
`quantity`: Number of pizzas sold per order
`total_price`: Revenue from each order line

This data structure allows for both granular item-level analysis and higher-level performance aggregation.

3) Executive Summary

After analyzing the pizza sales data using SQL, Python, and Power BI, key business insights were identified:
Revenue Drivers: A small group of pizzas (top 5) generated a significant portion of overall revenue.
Seasonality & Trends: Certain months and days consistently showed higher sales, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.
Catgory Performance: Classic and Chicken pizzas contributed the most to revenue, while Veggie pizzas showed potential for upselling strategies.
Order Value Optimization: Opportunities were found to increase average order value through cross-selling and upsizing promotions.
