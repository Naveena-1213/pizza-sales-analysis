# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Background and Overview
   
In today’s competitive food and beverage market, understanding product-level and category-level performance is key to driving revenue and customer loyalty.

This project focuses on analyzing a pizza restaurant's sales data to identify top-selling products, seasonal patterns, and opportunities for strategic growth.

### Objective:
Transform raw sales data into actionable business insights

Enable data-driven decision-making for marketing, inventory, and product development

## Data Structure Overview
The dataset includes transactional sales records with the following key fields:

- `Pizza_id`: Unique identifier for each pizza.
- `Pizza_name`: Name of the pizza.
- `Order_id`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Order_date`: Date when the order was placed.
- `Pizza_size`: Size of the pizza.
- `Quantity`: Number of pizzas ordered.
- `total_price`: Price per pizza.
- `pizza_category`: Different Categories of Pizza
- `Order_time`: Timestamp indicating the time of the order.

This data structure allows for both granular item-level analysis and higher-level performance aggregation.

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the pizza sales data using SQL, Python, and Power BI, key business insights were identified.

* Revenue Drivers: A small group of pizzas (top 5) generated a significant portion of overall revenue.

* Seasonality & Trends: Certain months and days consistently showed higher sales, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.
 
* Category Performance: Classic and Supreme pizzas contributed the most to revenue, while Veggie and chicken pizzas showed potential for upselling strategies.

* Order Value Optimization: Opportunities were found to increase average order value through cross-selling and upsizing promotions.

### * Seasonal Trends

Clear spikes in sales during weekends and monsoon season (e.g July).

Opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns during these peak periods.

## Recommendations
* Friday has the highest orders – so start giving good offers from Thursday evening itself.

* Classic and Supreme pizzas are top revenue makers – you can mix them with low-selling pizzas (like chicken and veggies) in a combo to push both.

* Large-size pizzas bring 46% of total revenue – give small discounts to move customers from Medium to Large.

* In September, sales are very low – so try launching limited-time special pizzas or seasonal offers only for that month to attract more customers.

* From 11 AM to 2 PM and again from 4 PM to 8 PM, orders are going high – so we can run ads and promotions from 10:30 AM and again from 4 PM to catch more buyers.

* Till July, the business is going great. But from August onwards, sales drop sharply – maybe because of the rainy season and people not stepping out.
  If we partner with strong home delivery services, we can boost sales even during rainy months when footfall is low.
